Program #3

Name:Omar Sanchez, 
Cosc 4730

Description: Runs like normal windows calculator, ran on borrowed pixel 2.

Anything that doesn't work: N/A

# Graded: 49/50 #

* Incomlete operations crash the app **(-1 point)**

Ex: open app, input 'x' (multiplication), then hit '='

It it important to not only allow for proper functionality, but keep a stable solution on invalid user input (whether the intentions be malicious or accidental).

* Negatives cannot be applied to answers **(-0 points)**

Ex: 14/2= and then negation does not change the 7 to a -7

Not required, but it would have been a nice functionality to have which can save some time rather than requiring the user to retype the answer as input and then negate it.
